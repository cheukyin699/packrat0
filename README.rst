A simple, locally insecure app that helps you keep track of your boxes during your move.

Warning: Do not expose this app on the network, because literally anyone can upload files and delete them.
It is recommended that this app be on some private network, in some private household, used by a loving
family. When the users are finished with the move and have finished unpacking everything, they have to
remember to pull the server down.
